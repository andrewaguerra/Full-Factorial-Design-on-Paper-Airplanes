# Full-Factorial-Design-on-Paper-Airplanes
Full factorial analysis of paper airplane flight distances using 3 two-level factors (paperclip positions). ANOVA and Tukey HSD identified significant effects of weight placement. Results show that no paperclips yield the farthest flights. Conducted in R with diagnostic checks.
